    <div class="img1"><img src="../photos/IMG_4203 (1).jpg"></div> Hello! My name is Caitlynne, but I prefer to go by Cait. I'm 23, and I live in Alaska. I am currently working on my bachelor's degree in Web Development. I originally started coding as a hobby, and eventually started to enjoy it so much that I decided it would be great for me to pursue professionally. My favorite part about coding is the end - when everything has come together and the end design looks just like I pictured. It's very rewarding and is a great reminder to not give up when coding becomes difficult. <hr></hr>
    <div class="img2"><img src="../photos/IMG_4229 (1).jpg"></div> On days that I am not coding, I enjoy reading and writing for fun. My favorite genres are romance and fantasy, and I enjoy writing stories in similar nature or poetry when the inspiration comes. I also game, and love spending hours building the perfect farm on Stardew Valley. It's really relaxing and brings me a lot of happiness. Other games that I enjoy include: Valorant, Overwatch, Dead by Daylight, and anything Resident Evil.
